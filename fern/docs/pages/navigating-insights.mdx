How-to explainer on the various options available within Insights

## Overview
The Maven Insights dashboard includes several different ways to visualize and analyze your data. Below is an overview of the various ways to filter and sort the information available.

## Navigation
Broadly, there are three different ways to manipulate the data within the Insights dashboard:

- **Filters / Search**
Filters and Search are available via the Search bar at the top of the page. (Look for the magnifying glass icon.) To apply filters/search, click into the search bar and either select a filter from the options presented in the drop down or simply begin typing your keyword for a content search. Once youâ€™ve selected your filter category, a second drop down menu will appear to select specific filters within that category. For example, selecting the Feedback filter will allow you to then select from the various Feedback types. You may apply multiple filters. 
- **Date Range**
In the upper left corner is a drop down menu to select from either a preset or custom date range. Date ranges entered here will be applied to all widgets in the dashboard.
- **Sorting and Changing Table Widgets**
In addition to dashboard-level filters, table widgets on the dashboard offer the ability to customize the columns displayed, sort columns by clicking the column header, and can be exported individually. Clicking any data point on a table widget will route you to the Conversations tab where you can see the conversations referenced within the Insights.
