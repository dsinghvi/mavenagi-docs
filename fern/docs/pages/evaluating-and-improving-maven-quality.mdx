## How to think about Maven quality

Maven is designed to answer support tickets, chat interactions and knowledge center searches with expert human quality. We thinking of a high quality support answer on three dimensions:

1. Factually correct, complete and helpful
2. Empathetic, personalized and with a human touch
3. Timely

## There are three drivers to Maven quality

1. **Knowledge** that is uploaded to Maven to enable it to retrieve facts used to answer questions
2. **User context** that enables Maven to personalize answers to be relevant to the user
3. **Personality** and writing styles that matches your brand voice and writing style

## Understanding quality

You can understand Maven quality in four ways

1. **Automatic self grading:** Maven has a self-grading mechanism that displays how confident it is based on how much relevant information it has in knowledge.
2. **Automatic grading against human responses:** Maven automatically grading historic tickets against human responses where human agent responses are available
3. **Human feedback** from Co-Pilot and End-user thumbs up and down
4. **Structured Evaluations:** A set of reference questions and answers is provided to Maven. Maven generates its own answers and scores itself against the reference answers. Evals can be created manually, by uploading a document of questions and answers, and by adding historic tickets into the eval set
