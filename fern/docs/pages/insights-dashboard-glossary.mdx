| Overall Maven Quality             | A calculated metric based on a mix of signals including human feedback, human responses, and other evaluation signals. It reflects the effectiveness and accuracy of Maven's responses or suggested responses in conversations. Quality is updated based on thumbs up or thumbs down feedback from users, with handoffs typically lowering the quality score. Inserts are not currently part of the quality calculation but may be in the future.                                                                                                                   |
| Overall Customer Sentiment        | An aggregate measurement of the sentiment rating of the Conversation as assessed and assigned by Maven. Sentiment ratings can be positive, negative, or neutral and are derived through analyzing text content from the Conversations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Maven Quality                     | A measurement of Maven’s confidence in its own answer. There are three categories of quality:<br><br>Good:  Maven’s self-assessment is that the answer was both correct and of high quality<br><br>Needs Improvement: Maven could not confidently answer the question due to a lack of knowledge or because the end user gave the interaction a thumbs down.<br><br>Ineligible/Pending:  Maven was unable to understand the query. This can happen for a variety of reasons, most commonly that there is something included in the query it cannot read or identify, such as a screenshot.  |
| Customer Sentiment                | The measurement of the sentiment rating of the Conversation as assessed and assigned by Maven broken down by day and sentiment ranking. Sentiment ratings can be positive, negative, or neutral and are derived through analyzing text content from the Conversations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Quality Improvement Opportunities | A breakdown of all conversations categorized as “Needs Improvement" by Maven showing the reason Maven marked its response as “Needs Improvement.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Handoff to Human Agent Rate       | A calculation of the overall percentage of conversations Maven handed off to an agent relative to the number of Maven responses with feedback or an action taken by a human agent (Thumbs up, thumbs down, or inserted.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
